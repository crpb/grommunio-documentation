Update Cycle
============

RH vs SUSE
----------

	“ *We do not want to update all that often, so we are
	choosing RHEL/CentOS/Alma/etc. [in favor of SLE]* ”

RHEL (and its derivatives) actually release a lot more service packs over time,
and the service packs' individual lifetime is also shorter:

=============  ==========  ================  ========
SP             Release     Last repo change  Lifetime
=============  ==========  ================  ========
AlmaLinux 8.4  2021-05-26  2021-11-22        181 days

SLE 15.2     2020-06-22  2021-12-31      558 days
SLE 15.3     2021-06-21  2024-12-31      559 days
========     ==========  ==============  ========

For admins with an aversion to periodic invocation of the updater, the update
cadence is in favor of a SUSE-based distribution.
