Login not possible
------------------

Because **grommunio-archive** makes use of the IMAP service (as login backend
and for means of recovery from archive), you have to keep in mind that every
user who is allowed to login to the archive also needs the permission to use
IMAP/POP which needs to be enabled in the API, see `Account
</admin/administration.html#account>_`.
