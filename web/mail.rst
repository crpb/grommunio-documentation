In this chapter, we guide you how to use mails with grommunio Web. After
reading through this chapter, you should be able to read, send and organize
your e-mails.

Mail reading
============

By default, the main content area in the mail interface is split into three
parts. In the left pane, the folder navigation area is visible. Right next to
the folder navigation area is the folder list area which lists all mails from
the particularly selected folder from the folder navigation area. Selecting an
e-mail from the folder automatically opens the e-mail in the main window area,
showing the e-mail effectively.

Mail sending
============

To compose a new mail, choose the highlighted "New Email" button from the main
shortcut bar.

#. Pressing the button will open a new mail tab with an empty
   ready-to-write-mail interface.
#. To add a recipient, either manually add this recipient by typing the
   recipient's mail address in the To:, CC: or BCC: fields. (BCC is available
   via the "Show BCC: field" button from the composition windows shortcut bar.)
   Alternatively, you can add a recipient by clicking the To: or CC: button to
   access the address book and select the recipients from a list.
#. The "Check names" button automatically checks for the recipients in the
   available address books and therefore auto-completes or either substitutes
   the manual entries with the corresponding address book objects.
#. Attachments can be added by choosing the "Paperclip" button from the
   composition window shortcut bar.
#. With the "Exclamation mark" button or the "Arrow Down" button, the priority
   of the mail can be raised or lowered.
#. When using HTML as a composition format (this is default), the main mail
   body provides a vast number of formatting options ranging from the choice of
   fonts, sizes, typographical typesetting and much more. It is generally
   recommended to keep individual styling at a modest level, because your
   recipient, depending on their used mail client, might receive a mail not in
   the intended format due to filtering or other potential mechanisms and
   implementations.
#. Pressing the "Floppy disk" button saves the mail, adding it to the Drafts
   folder. The message can be opened at a later time again to resume the
   composition.
#. Pressing the "Send" button sends the mail on the journey to the selected
   recipients. The draft is automatically moved to the Sent Items folder for
   future reference.
