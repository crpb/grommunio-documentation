Guided Installation (grommunio Appliance)
=========================================

grommunio delivers ready-to-use appliances for:

- bare metal or virtualized environments (ISO)
- container environments (docker)
- specialized, automated virtualization environments (OVA)

and a community image to run grommunio on a raspberry pi.

.. note::
   There are multiple ways of automation and deployment for grommunio available. Not all of these methods can be described - If you are looking for a special deployment type, don't hesitate to get in contact with one of grommunio's partners or with grommunio directly. grommunio is available from very small installations to large, hyperscale installations with millions of users.

To deploy grommunio via ISO, you need to make the installation media available to your installation target. The ISO is a generic, bootable installation medium which works in most scenarios. To deploy the ISO with bare metal, the ISO can be imaged to USB drives for simplified installation.

The grommunio Appliance is a general-purpose installation target, which comes with all components required for successful operation of grommunio. It already includes the operating system for simplified management and allows general purpose usage. Every appliance installation is automatically deployed with update servers ready-configured and services prepared for usage. If you are seeking a general-purpose and simple deployment, grommunio Appliance is the right place for you. Simplified update management, backups and full portability allow the appliance to operate for any installation target sizing 1-2000 users with adequate hardware sizing. For larger installations or installations with special deployment needs, such as - but not limited to - geographically split, cluster or hyperscale installations, please refer our partners and/or our support/professional services team. Alternatively, the combined information from the manual installation in this chapter together with the man page sections is sufficient to build the grommunio setup of your needs.

grommunio Appliance configuration with CUI/setup
------------------------------------------------

The grommunio console user interface (``grommunio-cui``) provides a
console interface which allows the administrator to perform basic
tasks to ready the appliance for
the admin UI (admin web interface) or admin CLI (admin command line
interface), such
as network configuration and time synchronization.

.. image:: _static/img/cui_1_main.png
   :alt: Main screen of grommunio-cui

Main screen
-----------

After starting ``grommunio-cui``, you are in the main screen. Upon login, you
are able to make system configuration changes.

In the main screen, the following functions are available:

- F1: Switching the color scheme (light vs. dark mode)
- F2: Login to unlock system configuration mode
- F5: Switching of keyboard layout
- L: Open system log viewer

Login
-----

.. image:: _static/img/cui_2_login.png
   :alt: Login

To enter into system configuration mode, press ``F2`` and log in with the system
superuser account (``root``).

.. important::
   The initial root password is unset (empty). When asked for password at first
   login, just enter an empty password.

Main configuration screen
-------------------------

The main menu provides the following functionality available to ``grommunio-cui``:

- Change system password
- Network configuration
- Timezone configuration
- Timesync configuration
- grommunio setup wizard
- Change Admin Web UI password
- Terminal
- Reboot
- Shutdown

.. image:: _static/img/cui_3_mainconfig.png
   :alt: Main configuration screen of grommunio-cui

Change system password
----------------------

The menu entry ``Change system password`` opens a window for setting the superuser
(``root``) account password. Do this directly after installation. Use a secure password.
We recommend using a password comprised of four words or more.

.. image:: _static/img/cui_4_change_sys_pass.png
   :alt: Changing the superuser password with grommunio-cui

Network configuration
---------------------

The menu entry ``Network configuration`` starts the network configuration utility
(``yast2 lan``), which provides support for all reasonable network
configuration settings. For detailed information on how to configure the
network by using the ``yast`` utility, refer to the online documentation
of YaST at
`https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP3/html/SLES-all/cha-network.html#sec-network-yast
<https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP3/html/SLES-all/cha-network.html#sec-network-yast>`_

.. image:: _static/img/cui_5_network.png
   :alt: Network configuration with YaST

.. important::
   The minimal set of configuration recommended to be changed includes:
   Hostname, Network Addressing (IP address), DNS (Nameservers), Routing (Default
   Gateway).

.. important::
   Note that using the domain ``localhost`` is not a valid hostname
   and/or ``local`` is not a valid domainname. Make sure to set the
   hostname and FQDN properly at all setup and installation stages for operating
   with a valid configuration.

Hostname & FQDN setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is a
requirement to setup the system hostname and domainname correctly.

Second, for local name resolving of services to work properly, the
correct entries should be either available in DNS and/or be set in ``/etc/hosts``.

To do this with the appliance, set the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in the
interface settings (which will be mirrored to ``/etc/hosts``) **and** in the
"Hostname/DNS" tab (the static hostname relates to ``/etc/hostname``). This way,
any services of the appliance will be able to use the correct addressing based
on the domain and host. A correct hostname/DNS setup is mandatory, especially for
multi-host setups.

   :alt: Hostname setting (affects ``/etc/hostname``)

.. image:: _static/img/yast_hostname_system.png
   :alt: Hostname resolution aid (affects ``/etc/hosts``)

.. important::
   To verify the settings, the command ``hostname`` should return the
   FQDN of the system.

Timezone configuration
----------------------

The menu entry ``Timezone configuration`` can be used to set the preferred
timezone displayed in server logs, etc. It has no practical impact on e-mails,
because mail user agents such as grommunio-web translate timestamps to the
timezone of the particular device the program is running on anyway.

.. image:: _static/img/cui_6_timezone.png
   :alt: Timezone configuration with YaST

Timesync configuration
----------------------

Timesync configuration is done with a simple interface providing the ability to
set the timezone according to your region and timezone of that region. It
generally is recommended to keep the setting ``Hardware Clock Set to UTC``,
since this provides the recommended timezone-agnostic behavior for services
(such as with logs, etc.).

.. image:: _static/img/cui_7_timesync.png
   :alt: Timesync configuration

After these basic setup, your grommunio Appliance should:

- be able to connect to the Internet (availability of Updates, etc.)
- have a valid timezone set
- have a valid timeserver configured, with the system time appropriately
  synchronized

grommunio setup wizard
----------------------

With the previous basic setup steps completed, it is recommended to run the
grommunio setup wizard to complete the configuration based on your needs.

The menu entry ``grommunio setup wizard`` initiates the ``grommunio-setup``
program which walks you through the initial setup of grommunio.

.. important::
   While grommunio-setup can be executed more than once,
   running through the setup process of grommunio-setup always resets the
   entire installation. grommunio-setup automatically detects if it has been
   run already and will warn you that, if you continue, all data stored will be
   lost.

Welcome screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting ``grommunio-setup`` presents you with a descriptive welcome screen.

.. image:: _static/img/cui_8_setup_welcome.png
   :alt: grommunio-setup: welcome screen

Repository setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As first step, ``grommunio-setup`` requests you to enter subscription details.
These subscription details are included in your purchase of the product,
alongside with the subscription certificate delivered for installation at a
later stage. If left empty, grommunio-setup will automatically include the
community repositories.

.. note::
   Community repositories are delivered on a best-effort basis and are not
   supported. While grommunio welcomes community members to use grommunio, the
   software distribution available with the subscription repositories include
   production-relevant benefits. Subscription repositories (available only with
   a valid subscription) include quality-tested packages, hotfixes and extra
   features not available with community repositories.

.. image:: _static/img/cui_9_setup_repository.png
   :alt: grommunio-setup: repository setup

Database variant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the next stage of ``grommunio-setup``, you are requested to specify which
central database type you want to configure. Most installations use the local
database installation, where the MySQL-database is initialized and prepared
automatically. For larger and/or special setups, e.g. clusters, multi-node and distributed setups, it might be recommended to
connect to an already existing database instead.

.. image:: _static/img/cui_10_setup_dbchoice.png
   :alt: grommunio-setup: choice of database variant

Database settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the choice of "local database", the next installation step will
automatically provide you with information which is used for initialization of
the database. For standard setups, it is recommended to go with the default
values. The values for the installation are generated randomly, which protects
your installation from unauthorized access.

.. image:: _static/img/cui_11_setup_dbsettings.png
   :alt: grommunio-setup: settings for database initialization

Administration User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After setting up the database, a default administrator password is requested
for the login with the grommunio Admin API. The default user (``admin``) is
then initialized with the password entered here. By default, grommunio
automatically generates a password and shows it at the end of the setup
procedure.

.. important::
   At the end of the setup procedure, the password entered here will be shown in
   the summary screen after setup. Make sure no unauthorized people are
   accessing or viewing the system console for retrieval of this major
   credential.

.. note::
   You can always reset this password at a later stage through ``grommunio-cui``.

.. image:: _static/img/cui_12_setup_adminpw.png
   :alt: grommunio-setup: setting of the admin password

Fully Qualified Domain Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next stage of ``grommunio-setup`` requests the configuration of the fully
qualified domain name (FQDN). The FQDN traditionally consists of the
**hostname**, combined with the primary **domain** of the system. The name
chosen here is strongly recommended to be part of the certificates generated at
a later stage in ``grommunio-setup``.

.. image:: _static/img/cui_13_setup_fqdn.png
   :alt: grommunio-setup: setting the fully qualified domain name (fqdn)

Primary mail domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By continuing to the next stage, it is requested to provide the primary mail
domain. The primary mail domain is important as main system domain for further
system configuration.

.. image:: _static/img/cui_14_setup_primarydomain.png
   :alt: grommunio-setup: setting the primary mail domain

Relayhost configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the installation is not to be directly sending E-Mails (by resolving the
recipients' MTAs directly), a relayhost is recommended to be set. This next
step allows the configuration of a relayhost which for example can be used for
integration with existing firewalls or mail security appliances. If the
configured target should be used directly (by requesting the IP address through
DNS A records instead of the associated MX records), the relayhost should be
enclosed with square brackets, like "[mail.isp.com]".

.. image:: _static/img/cui_15_setup_relayhost.png
   :alt: grommunio-setup: configuration of relayhost

TLS configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next step of configuration with ``grommunio-setup`` provides a menu with a
choice of the preferred TLS setup with the grommunio installation:

.. image:: _static/img/cui_16_setup_tlsmode.png
   :alt: grommunio-setup: choosing the TLS installation mode

0: **Creation of self-signed certificate**

   Creating your own self-signed certificate is the simplest option - Creating
   an own self-signed certificate will though show up as untrusted at first
   connect and needs to be trusted before continuing. This behavior is normal
   and is because any client that connects has no possibility validation if the
   certificate has a valid source. This setting is the default and does not
   require any preparation for certificate generation. grommunio does not
   recommend this option for production environments, as this option requires
   any client to first trust the certificate in use. This option is the best
   for validation and demo installations of grommunio.

.. image:: _static/img/cui_17_setup_selfsigned.png
   :alt: grommunio-setup: Creating a self-signed certificate

1: **Creation of own CA (certificate authority) and certificate**

   Creating your own certificate authority is an extended option which allows
   you to create self-signed certificates with an own certificate authority.
   This way, you can (manually) create further certificates under the umbrella
   of a own central authority with multiple server certificates to be signed by
   the same certificate authority generated by yourself. This option is the
   best for validation and demo installation of larger installations of
   grommunio with multiple instances.

.. image:: _static/img/cui_18_setup_ownca.png
   :alt: grommunio-setup: Creating own certificate authority (CA) and certificate

2: **Import of an existing TLS certificate from files**

   Importing your own certificate allows any type of external certificate pair
   (PEM-encoded) to be used with your grommunio installation. Note that it is
   recommended to either use SAN certificates with multiple domains or a
   wildcard certificate. With your choice of your own TLS certificates, you
   have the highest flexibility to either use a trusted CA or a publicly signed
   certificate by an officially trusted certification authority including, but
   not limited to, Thawte, Digicert, Comodo or others.

.. image:: _static/img/cui_19_setup_importcert.png
   :alt: grommunio-setup: Importing existing certificate

3: **Automatic generation of certificates with Let's Encrypt**

   Using this option allows the automatic certificate generation process with
   the Let's Encrypt certificate authority. Using Let's Encrypt certificates is
   free of charge, however the terms of service by Let's Encrypt apply, which
   are referenced during installation. Using this option automatically requests
   the domains from the selection you made, and automatically starts the
   validation process. For this automated process to work successfully, Let's
   Encrypt verifies _all_ defined domain names by creating a challenge on the
   appliance. For this to work, port 80 (HTTP) needs to be accessible from the
   Internet during this step of verification (and any subsequent automated
   renewal) with all the domains pointing to the appliance. This option is
   recommended for any simple installation and allows the most seamless
   installation experience if prepared correctly.

.. image:: _static/img/cui_20_setup_letsencrypt.png
   :alt: grommunio-setup: Generating Let's Encrypt certificates

Any certificates so generated are placed in ``/etc/grommunio/ssl`` and are
automatically referenced by any services of the appliance.

Setup finalization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After all above steps of ``grommunio-setup`` have been completed, the final
dialog shows the summarized information of the installation is shown as
reference.

.. image:: _static/img/cui_21_setup_final.png
   :alt: grommunio-setup: Setup finalization

.. important::
   All installation/setup relevant information is stored at
   /var/log/grommunio-setup.log. This file includes the passwords used for
   initialization which you may copy to a secure location or delete if not
   required anymore.

Admin web password reset
------------------------

The menu entry ``Admin web password reset`` changes the password of the main
administration user (``admin``). For administrators which want to execute this
option without running ``grommunio-cui`` first, this can be done anytime by
executing the command ``grommunio-admin passwd``.

.. image:: _static/img/cui_22_admin_passwd.png
   :alt: Admin Web password reset

Terminal
--------

The option ``Terminal`` enables a class shell with the ability to exit back to
``grommunio-cui`` by issuing the ``exit`` command at any given time. This
option should be used with care and only by experienced administrators.

.. image:: _static/img/cui_23_terminal.png
   :alt: Staring Terminal (root privileges)

.. important::
   Note that the Terminal executed here provides full administrative
   rights (root access) to the Appliance. With this level of permissions it is
   recommended to proceed with extreme caution.

Reboot
------

.. image:: _static/img/cui_24_reboot.png
   :alt: Rebooting grommunio Appliance

The option ``Reboot`` reboots the entire grommunio Appliance. Note that
during the reboot the services provides will not be available.

Shutdown
--------

.. image:: _static/img/cui_25_shutdown.png
   :alt: Shut down grommunio Appliance

The option ``Shutdown`` shuts down the entire grommunio Appliance. Note
that until the Appliance has been made available again by starting it again,
the services will not be available.
